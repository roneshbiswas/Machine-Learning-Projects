# Bangladesh Weather Forecasting

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to collect and analyze Bangladesh's weather temperature data to forecast future temperatures. The project aims to build an accurate forecasting model by leveraging time series analysis and machine learning techniques.

---

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle - Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data).

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded the raw dataset and cleaned missing or inconsistent data.
   - Processed the data to ensure it is ready for time series analysis.

2. **Time Series Decomposition**:
   - Decomposed the time series data into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
   - Analyzed these components to understand the behavior of temperature data over time.

3. **Stationarity Check**:
   - Conducted the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity in the data.

4. **Autocorrelation Analysis**:
   - Generated Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to determine the parameters for the ARIMA model.

5. **Model Building and Evaluation**:
   - Built an **ARIMA model** using training data and evaluated its performance on test data.
   - Implemented the **Prophet model** and compared its performance with the ARIMA model.

## Performance Results
- **ARIMA Model**:
  - Order: (2, 0, 20)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): **6.018**
  - Error Percentage: **23%**

- **Prophet Model**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): **0.509**
  - Error Percentage: **2%**

The Prophet model significantly outperformed the ARIMA model in terms of forecasting accuracy.

---

## Visualization and Analysis
- Plotted and analyzed the decomposed time series components.
- Created ACF and PACF plots to understand lag relationships.
- Visualized the forecasted results from both ARIMA and Prophet models.
